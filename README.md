### Hello there

I'm a complete newbie in coding, and as I start a 2-year computer science course in summer 2021, I want to build some pretty basic starter projects and share them here, although I'm pretty sure nobody will ever read this lol. 
It's gonna start with Python and a text based rpg game in it's simplest form, and will probably go on from there with a discord bot as a second project.
